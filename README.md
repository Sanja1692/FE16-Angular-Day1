Classwork | Day 1
Create an Angular Single-Page-Application with two pages, Home Page and About us Page. The theme of the App should be a Tourist Agency (design example below).

The Home page should have a hero section with a Heading and short text. Additionally a button with a text of "Learn more". Under the Hero section in three columns and two rows display 6 different tourist destination with their names, price, number of nights and city.

When the user clicks on "Learn more" button redirect him to About us page, where you should display a few info about the company.

Make sure to implement the following Angular Concepts:

- Two Pages (components which will nest another components) Home page and About us Page

- The Navbar should be a separate component

- The Hero section should be a separate component

- Implement routing for navigating between the pages

- Use interpolation for displaying data into the Template

- Use the Bootstrap library for styling the App
